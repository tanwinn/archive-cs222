There are various "classes" of formal languages. Tradeoffs between power and efficiency.

## Formalization: Chomsky hierarchy
- Regular languages (type 3 in the hierarchy)
- context-free language (type 2) (lower number = more poert, less efficiency)

## Tokenizing uses regular languages
3 equivalent definitions of regular languages
- regular expression
- finite automata
- regular grammar

### Regular expressions (RE)
Patterns for string generation/matching
Def, which is recursive:
#### Base case
1. /0 (empty set) is a RE. It matches no string
2. E (Epsilon) is a RE. It matches only and only the empty string (Notation E = empty string)
3. For every alphabet symbol a, a is a RE. It matches "a" and nothing else

#### Recursive case
1. Union: if A is a RE and B is a RE, then A|B (or A U B) isa RE. It matches anything A matches or anything B matches.
2. Concanation: A RE, B RE. AB is a re. It matches anything that can be decomposeed into a prefix that A matches and the rest that B matches.
3. Kleene Star: A RE. A* is a RE. It matches anything that can be broken into zero or more pieces, each matching A. A* matches the empty string.

#### Examples: 
((0|1)2)* = ((0 or 1) 2)* = (02 or 12)*
Strings of even length, start with a 0 or 1, and alternate between non-2's and 2's. 

#### 2 other operations 
- Kleene Plus: A+ = AA* --> "one or more"
- Optional: A? = (E|A)  --> "one or few" 

### Programming Language alphabets
are really big
- Shorthand: [a-z] - a|b|c|...|z, [A-Z], [0-9], [A-Za-z0-9] = [a-z]|[A-Z]|[0-9]
- Dot . : anything single character
- [^a]: anything not a
e.g.: [^0-9]: not a digit


### Exercises
Write REs for:
- L = string of 0's and 1's with an even number of 0's
- int T 
--> [1-9][0-9]\*|0 --> no leading 0's, negative is annotation
Order of ops: * is highest, then concat, then |
-?[1-9][0-9]\*|0 --> part of int

- REs are vey efficient computationally. Given a RE and a strong of length a, O(n) slgorithm to check of string matches RE

- How? Finie automata. A finite automata (FA) is a type of machine (simple compiler)

## Finite automata has
- No memory
- consists of a finite number of states
- Special states are called start state, accept state
- Transition rules; given current state and nuext input symbol, tells you next state to go
